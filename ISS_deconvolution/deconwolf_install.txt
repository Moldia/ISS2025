🐺 Deconwolf Installation Guide

This guide walks you through cloning, building, and installing the Deconwolf executable.

---

✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Git
- CMake
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++, or MSVC)

### Ubuntu/Debian Example:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install git cmake build-essential

---

📥 Step 1: Clone the Repository

    git clone https://github.com/elgw/deconwolf.git
    cd deconwolf

---

🏗 Step 2: Create and Enter Build Directory

    mkdir builddir
    cd builddir

---

⚙️ Step 3: Configure the Project

    cmake ..

---

🔨 Step 4: Build the Project

    cmake --build .

This compiles the project and produces the main binary, typically named `dw-<version>`.

---

✅ Step 5: Verify the Build

Try running the tool from the build directory:

    ./dw-0.4.5 --help

You should see the usage information if the build was successful.

---

📦 Step 6: Install the Binary System-Wide

To make the tool available globally and use a cleaner command name, copy and rename the binary into `/usr/local/bin`:

    sudo cp ./dw-0.4.5 /usr/local/bin/deconwolf

Now you can run:

    deconwolf --help

from any directory.

Happy deconvolving!
