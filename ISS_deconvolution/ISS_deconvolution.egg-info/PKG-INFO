In the `ISS_deconvolution` module, we apply denoising/deconvolution methods to sharpen the images of the rolling circle products, before proceeding to decoding. This is especially advantageous in case of low magnification imaging and/or in signal-crowded tissues, because deconvolution helps separating nearby dots and their respective signals. 

Deconvolution is implemented with the `RedLionFish` library.
